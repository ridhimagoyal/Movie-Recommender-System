# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using Python. The system aims to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and historical data. It leverages techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods to provide accurate recommendations.

## Dataset

The system is built using a movie dataset containing information like movie titles, genres, ratings, and user interactions. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and loaded correctly before running the notebook.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to explore and execute the code:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook movie_recommender.ipynb
    ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results

The system generates movie recommendations tailored to user preferences. Below are examples of outputs you can expect:

- Top N movie recommendations for a specific user.
- Insights into the system's performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision, recall).
